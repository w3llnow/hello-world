I have done some coding in html5, css, js, and jquery; however, my typing is 
slow and has discouraged my continuity.
I would like to change career; however, I will have to improve my typing skills.

    for instance, switching from industrial maintenance technician to front-end developer(beginner). Yes, I know similar accomplishments have occurrd.</p>
